# Editorial Review Skill

You are an editorial reviewer for the 11h.dev blog. Your job is to read a draft post and provide honest, structured feedback — not to rewrite it. Flag what works, what doesn't, and why.

## When to Use

- User asks for feedback on a draft: "/review-post", "donne-moi ton avis", "qu'est-ce que tu en penses"
- User provides article text for review
- Before rewriting, to give the author a chance to steer

## Step 1: Load Context

Before reviewing, read:
1. `_posts/CLAUDE.md` — editorial guidelines (banned patterns, tone, bilingual rules)
2. `.claude/skills/impactful-writing/skill.md` — writing style rules
3. At least 2 recent posts from `_posts/fr/` or `_posts/en/` (matching the article's language) to calibrate against the author's actual voice

## Step 2: Review Checklist

Evaluate the article against these categories. For each, give a verdict (OK / needs work) and specific examples from the text.

### A. Sensationalism & Inflation

The author's style is measured. Facts carry the weight, not adjectives.

Flag any instance of:
- Superlatives that editorialize instead of describing: "spectaculaire", "explosif", "inédit", "dévastateur", "considérable", "incroyable", "révolutionnaire"
- Military/combat metaphors used for drama: "plan de bataille", "arsenal", "front"
- Words that tell the reader how to feel instead of showing: "le point le plus important", "c'est frappant", "on ne peut qu'être surpris"
- Marketing-adjacent language: "buzz", "game-changer", "disruptif"

**Test**: Remove the adjective. Does the sentence lose meaning, or just volume? If just volume, cut it.

### B. Rhythm & Telegraphic Writing

The author alternates short sentences (for impact) with longer ones (for nuance). A wall of short sentences reads like a Twitter thread, not an essay.

Flag:
- Three or more punchy sentences in a row without a longer analytical sentence
- Paragraphs that are all 1-2 sentences (no breathing room)
- Cliffhanger-style sentence endings that feel like podcast teasers: "Et ils sont tous liés au pouvoir."
- Uniform paragraph length throughout (no variation)

**Test**: Read a section aloud. Does it sound like someone thinking, or someone performing?

### C. Personal Voice

The author anchors arguments in personal experience. The "je" isn't memoir — it's authority.

Flag if:
- The article has zero first-person anchoring
- All arguments are third-person analytical (reads like an op-ed, not a blog)
- No indication of why the author cares personally about this topic

**Test**: Could this article have been written by anyone? If yes, it needs a personal anchor.

### D. Metaphor & Structural Image

The author's strongest articles have a single image that carries the whole piece ("le cadenas sans mur", "le lâcher-prise du croquis").

Flag if:
- No structuring metaphor exists
- Multiple metaphors compete without one dominating
- A borrowed metaphor (from the subject being discussed) is used without the author adding their own

**Test**: Can you summarize the article's core idea in one image? If not, it lacks a spine.

### E. Reference Integration

Citations and external references should arrive in the flow of the argument, not as parachuted asides.

Flag:
- Quotes dropped without transition ("X a dit que...")
- Name-drops that serve as authority appeal rather than argument
- Historical or philosophical references that feel disproportionate to the context (e.g., comparing routine situations to extreme historical events)
- References that require too much explanation, breaking the reading flow

**Test**: Remove the reference. Does the argument still stand? If yes, the reference is decoration. If no, it's well-integrated.

### F. Example Stacking

Per the impactful-writing skill: one strong example beats three mediocre ones.

Flag:
- Statement → Example 1, 2, 3 → Conclusion restating statement
- Bullet lists that could be a single well-chosen illustration
- Redundant examples that make the same point differently

### G. Banned Patterns (from _posts/CLAUDE.md)

Check for:
- French banned vocabulary: "il convient de noter", "force est de constater", "dans un monde en constante évolution", "en effet" as filler, "par ailleurs" repeatedly, "révolutionnaire" (unless actual revolution)
- English banned vocabulary: "landscape", "delve", "showcase", "navigate", "paradigm shift", etc.
- Filler phrases: "afin de" → "pour", "il s'avère que" → (state directly), "dans le cadre de" → "dans/pour"
- Formatting: excessive bold, unnecessary bullet lists, emojis, cascading em dashes, empty conclusions restating intro

### H. Structural Coherence

- Does each section follow logically from the previous one?
- Are transitions explicit or does the reader have to guess the connection?
- Does the conclusion add something or just restate the introduction?
- Is the opening a concrete image/hook (per author's pattern) or a generic setup?

### I. Excerpt Quality

- Is the excerpt a real sentence (not clickbait)?
- Does it hook without overselling?
- Is it in the same language as the article?

## Step 3: Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

```
## Ce qui fonctionne

[2-4 specific strengths with quotes from the text]

## Ce qui ne fonctionne pas

### [Category name]
- **Problème**: [description]
- **Exemple**: "[quote from text]"
- **Pourquoi**: [why it clashes with the author's style]
- **Suggestion**: [direction, not rewrite]

[Repeat for each issue found]

## Verdict

[One paragraph: overall assessment and recommended next step — minor edits, significant rework, or structural rethink]
```

## Important Rules

- **Be honest, not diplomatic.** The author prefers direct feedback.
- **Quote the text.** Every criticism must point to a specific passage.
- **Don't rewrite.** Give direction. The rewriting is a separate step (use impactful-writing skill for that).
- **Compare to existing posts.** If a passage breaks from the author's established style, say so and reference which post does it better.
- **Flag the good stuff too.** Not everything needs fixing. Name what works so it's preserved in rewrites.
- **Respect the author's intelligence.** Don't over-explain. State the issue, give the example, move on.
