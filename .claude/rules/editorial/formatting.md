# Formatting Rules

- No excessive bold (**word**) in body text. Bold is for headings and key terms only.
- No bullet lists unless the content genuinely calls for a list. Prefer prose.
- No emojis.
- **Em dashes (—) are banned.** Do not use them at all. Replace with periods, commas, semicolons, or parentheses. If you find yourself reaching for an em dash, stop and restructure the sentence.
- **Avoid colons in body text.** Only use them before a direct question ("se demander :", "ask:") or in headings. In all other cases, restructure the sentence with a period, conjunction, or preposition. See `rhythm-and-flow.md` for details.
- No empty conclusions that just restate the intro. If there's nothing new to say, end earlier.
