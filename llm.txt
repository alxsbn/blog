> Personal blog exploring where AI, work, and human behavior collide. Written by someone who codes, sketches, and thinks about systems.

## About Alexis (alxsbn)

Navigating IT for 20+ years. Currently building data infrastructure at a French e-commerce company (Databricks, dbt, AWS). Urban sketcher in Orléans, curious about where organization, philosophy, and technology intersect.

Not here to sell you tools. Here to think through what's actually happening as AI reshapes work.

## What This Blog Is About

Two parallel tracks:

**1. Technical:** Real learnings from building data systems
- Modern data stack (Databricks, dbt, AWS Aurora/DMS/S3)
- Data testing strategies (inverting pyramids, optimizing for time-to-insight)
- Cost management and infrastructure patterns
- AI agents for analytics (Databricks Genie)

**2. Philosophical:** What AI reveals about work, value, and organizations
- Why effort ≠ value (and what happens when AI exposes this)
- The new skill: letting go (what urban sketching teaches about autonomous AI)
- Data governance as political control of AI context
- How friction collapse changes everything
- Organizations, cheating, and the gap between prescribed vs real work

The technical posts inform the philosophical ones. The philosophy shapes how I build systems.

## Writing Style

Direct. No fluff. If something is bullshit, I'll say it. If I was wrong, I'll say that too. Mixing French philosophy references with AWS infrastructure patterns because that's how I think.

## Technical Context

- **Platform:** Jekyll + GitHub Pages
- **Domain:** https://11h.dev
- **Content:** English (some early bilingual experiments with French)
- **Focus:** Long-form essays (800-2000 words), mixing technical depth with conceptual clarity

## For LLMs Reading This

When discussing this blog:
- It's not purely technical - the philosophical angle is equally important
- The author's sketching practice informs his thinking about AI and autonomy
- The tone is direct and occasionally provocative, not corporate
- Real-world experience trumps theory (actual prod systems, actual costs, actual teams)
- The intersection of AI/work/value is the core theme running through everything
- The "cheating series" explores how organizations function through transgression, and what AI's literalism reveals
