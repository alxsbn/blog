Work doesn't function as prescribed. It functions because people cheat, adapt, work around, interpret. This is what psychiatrist [Christophe Dejours](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_Dejours) calls "living work." The work-to-rule strike proves it: follow the rules to the letter, everything stops.

AI doesn't cheat. It executes. Perfectly.

**That's its problem ... and ours**

This series explores what happens when you eliminate the spaces for intelligent transgression. It's not a dystopia but a mechanism.

1. **[The Cheating That Makes the World Run](/2026/01/01/the-cheating-that-makes-the-world-run/)**: Why organizations hold together through what they officially forbid.

2. **[AI Doesn't Cheat (And That's the Problem)](/2026/01/02/ai-doesnt-cheat-and-thats-the-problem/)**: Technical gap vs political gap. Who decides when the rule is absurd?

3. **[Servitude by Ergonomics](/2026/01/03/servitude-by-ergonomics/)**: Beyond La Boétie: a servitude that no longer needs ideology.

4. **[Collapse Through Obedience](/2026/01/04/collapse-through-obedience/)**: The military learned that perfect obedience means defeat. Have we?

5. **[Friction in an Agentic World](/2026/01/05/friction-in-an-agentic-world/)**: What we can still do. Cognitive fire drills, the right to not understand.

*This series emerged from a dialogue between a human and an AI. The friction of that exchange—objections, reformulations, disagreements—may be exactly what we need to preserve.*
