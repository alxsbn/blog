excerpt: "What urban sketching taught me about letting AI run for hours. The skill nobody talks about: letting go."

Every Saturday morning in Orléans, a group gathers with sketchbooks. Some are architects. Some haven't drawn since high school. They're all here for [Urban Sketchers](https://urbansketchers.org/)—and they all face the same challenge.

It's not perspective. It's not color mixing.

It's **letting go**.

## The beginner's trap

New sketchers want to control everything. They reach for the eraser. They restart when a line goes wrong. They freeze, pencil hovering, afraid to commit.

The experienced sketcher? They embrace the "wrong" line. They work with accidents. They trust the process.

The difference isn't talent. It's **productive discomfort**—the ability to keep moving when you don't control the outcome.

## The coder's trap

I've spent years writing code. And I've noticed something: developers have the same problem.

We want to see every line. Review every change. Understand every decision. The idea of letting an AI write code for hours, unsupervised? That's terrifying.

Yet here's Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, [sharing his stats](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2004626064187031831): 259 PRs, 497 commits, 40k lines added in 30 days. Every line written by Claude.

> "I let Claude run for hours with a well-prepared plan and hooks that allow me to step away."

Opus 4.5 can run for 4+ hours autonomously. The [YOLO mode](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) in Claude Code lets you say "just do it" and walk away.

The skill isn't prompting. It's **letting go**.

## Letting go ≠ giving up

Here's what Urban Sketching taught me: letting go isn't abandonment. It's **prepared trust**.

Before I sketch, I:
- Choose my composition
- Decide what to emphasize
- Accept what I'll ignore

Before YOLO mode, you:
- Write a clear plan
- Set up hooks (guardrails)
- Define success criteria

In both cases, the work happens *before* you let go. The lâcher-prise is earned.

## A pattern across arts

This isn't unique to sketching. Letting go appears everywhere mastery exists:

| Art form | The letting go |
|----------|----------------|
| **Jazz** | Improvisation over known changes |
| **Action painting** | Pollock's gesture over precision |
| **Street photography** | Cartier-Bresson's "decisive moment" |
| **Automatic writing** | Surrealists bypassing conscious control |
| **Contact improvisation** | Responding to your partner, not choreography |

Every art form has this moment: you prepare, then you *release*.

Coding never had this. Until now.

## A new art form?

Photography (1839). Cinema (1895). Video art (1960s). Digital art (1980s). Generative art (2000s).

Each technology created new forms of creative expression. Each required artists to develop new relationships with control.

What's emerging now isn't "AI art" in the sense of "AI makes art."

It's something else: **human + autonomous AI as collaborative medium**.

Like a jazz duo, but your partner has trained on everything ever written. Like contact improvisation, but your partner never tires and has infinite patience.

The human role shifts from *executor* to *composer of constraints*. You design the system, set the boundaries, then... let go.

## The skill issue

In a [previous post](/2025/12/30/the-10x-is-here-its-a-skill-issue/), I argued the 10x developer boost from AI is real—but it's a skill issue.

I now think the skill is simpler than I thought.

It's not prompt engineering. It's not system design. It's not even taste.

It's the same skill that separates the frozen beginner from the flowing sketcher:

**The willingness to be productively uncomfortable.**
