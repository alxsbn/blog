## The Cost-Friction Connection

[Scott Adams argues](https://www.youtube.com/live/y5ZkIDUuHAM?si=FOb7B9Oj-9lug93J) that laziness is a cognitive bug: we fixate on *cost* rather than benefit. Too busy calculating effort to see the payoff.

[BJ Fogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8) found the same pattern from a different angle. Cost, he realized, is just another word for *friction*. Want to floss daily? Don't focus on the full routine—just floss one tooth after brushing. The toothbrush is already in your hand. Friction: near zero. Behavior: unlocked.

**This insight—reduce friction, trigger action—is what made Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok billion-user platforms.** Infinite scroll isn't an accident. It's Fogg's framework weaponized.

But here's the question neither Adams nor Fogg anticipated:

**What happens when friction doesn't just drop—but disappears entirely?**

## AI: The Friction Eraser

AI just did that. Not "reduced friction." Eliminated it.

- **Same outcome, zero effort**: GPT writes the email in 3 seconds
- **Same effort, 100x output**: Developer with Copilot ships 10x faster
- **Different process entirely**: Dall-E bypasses the whole design journey

For a century, effort and outcome moved together. More input → more output. The correlation was so reliable we stopped distinguishing between them.

**Effort became the proxy for value.**

But AI broke the correlation. The variables decouple. And suddenly we're forced to ask:

**What were we actually optimizing for? The effort, or the result?**

## The Uncomfortable Answer

Most of us don't know.

We *say* we want outcomes. But we designed entire industries around effort-as-signal:
- Lawyers bill by the hour, not by problem solved
- Academia rewards publications, not insight
- Corporate culture celebrates "hustle," not results

When the effort vanishes, so does the perceived value—even when the outcome is identical.

**The trap wasn't working hard on worthless tasks.**

**The trap was never asking: was it the struggle or the solution that mattered?**

## What This Reveals

AI isn't exposing lazy workers. It's exposing confused values.

For decades, we bundled three different things into one:
1. **Effort** (the input—hours, sweat, grind)
2. **Process** (the transformation—learning, growth, craft)
3. **Outcome** (the output—deliverable, result, artifact)

We treated them as the same because they *came* bundled. To get #3, you needed #2, which required #1.

**AI unbundles them.**

Now you can have outcome without effort. Or effort without outcome. Or skip the whole process and jump straight to results.

Which one did you actually care about?

## Three Futures

### 1. The Outcome Economy
Pure results. Effort becomes invisible. Ultra-efficient, ultra-alienating. Work becomes entirely transactional.

### 2. The Process Renaissance
We rediscover which journeys matter. Learning, craft, relationships—domains where the *doing* is the value. Friction becomes intentional.

### 3. The Split (most likely)
Commodity outcomes get automated. Humans gravitate toward process-rich work. But we'll need new language to tell them apart—and new ways to value both.

## The Real Question

Not: "Will AI make us lazy?"

But: **"What were we actually building when we thought we were working hard?"**

Was it the outcome? Use the tools. You were trapped by lack of leverage.

Was it the process? Be deliberate. You might need friction.

Was it the performance of effort itself? Find a better signal. That game was always hollow.

**AI doesn't expose bad work. It exposes unclear intentions.**

The friction is gone. Now we have to choose what we were really after.
