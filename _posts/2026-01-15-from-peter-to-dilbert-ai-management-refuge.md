## 1969: The Peter Principle

**In a hierarchy, every employee rises to their level of incompetence.**

You're a good developer? They promote you to lead. Good lead? They make you director. Until you reach the position where you become bad. There, you stay.

Peter's conclusion: work is done by those who haven't yet reached their ceiling.

## 1995: The Dilbert Principle

Scott Adams observes something else. We don't promote the good until they fail. We directly promote the bad to get them out of the productive flow.

> "The most inefficient workers are moved to where they can do the least damage: management."

Management is no longer a reward. It's a quarantine.

## What If Everyone Became a Manager?

Before, being a manager was a privilege. A minority accessed it.

Now, you open Claude, and you lead.

So the filter changes.

**Managing a human tolerates vagueness.** Alignment meetings. The politically acceptable.

**Managing an AI demands clarity.** It doesn't "feel". It executes what you formulate.

## The Inversion

The Dilbert Principle reverses.

Adams thought management protected the incompetent.

**AI exposes them.**

Peter described the rise toward incompetence. Adams, the refuge in incompetence.

**AI removes the refuge.**
